## g0v summit 2020 features

### Feature 1 / Global citizen technology event
In previous g0v Summits, participants with rich experience from all over the world came to Taiwan.  They exchanged experiences with nearly 1,000 congregations through speeches, discussions, and workshops.

### Feature 2 / Open source collaboration
g0v Summit focuses on the exchange of experience of activists. We hope to hear speakers and participants put forward solutions to social problems, whether it is to share inspirational success stories or learn from failures. Through venue arrangements and agenda design, g0v Summit aims for sincere exchanges to happen, let action-takers find motivations from each other to move forward.

### Feature 3 / Deeply Connecting Local Communities
g0v Summit 2020 leave Taipei for the first time and will be held in Tainan. The g0v Summit 2020 working group collaborated with local partners in Tainan for one year to connect the maker communities, NGOs, cultural workers, educators in Tainan and neighboring cities, to gather community contributors and civic hackers, who are accustomed to virtual space, together to listen to each other's stories and understand each other through dialogue.

## g0v Summit 2020 content
Compared to the previous g0v Summit, which lasted for 2-3 days with a single venue, g0v Summit 2020 expanded its participation and connected the local communities, launching 4 consecutive days of hackathons, short talks, themed forums, free dialogue, and unconference. Workshops and event venues have also been extended to several locations in different places in the urban area, including spaces and masses that have been operated by local communities for many years.
