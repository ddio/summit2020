## g0v Summit 2020 Features

### Civic Hacking Global Event
In previous g0v Summits, participants with rich experience from all over the world came to Taiwan. With nearly 1,000 participants, they have shared ideas and experiences through speeches, discussions, and workshops.

### Open-Source Collaboration
g0v Summit focuses on the exchange of practical experience. We hope to hear speakers and participants put forward solutions to social issues, whether they are stories of success or lessons from failure. Through programming and design of venue space, g0v Summit aims to facilitate sincere exchanges to take place, let action-takers find inspiration and motivations from each other.

### Grassroots Connections
g0v Summit 2020 is the first summit outside of Taipei. In Tainan, the g0v Summit 2020 Working Group has worked with local partners in Tainan for a year to build grassroots connections with the maker communities, NGOs, cultural workers, and educators in Tainan as well as neighboring cities. g0v Summit is where civic hackers, who are accustomed to virtual space, gather with community contriburtors in the physical space, and listen to each other’s stories and understand each other through dialogue.

Workshops and event venues have also been extended to several locations in different places in the urban area, including spaces and masses that have been operated by local communities for many years.
