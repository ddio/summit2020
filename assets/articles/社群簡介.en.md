## What is g0v?
Since 2012, the civic hacking movement has been sweeping across the globe. g0v, a community that advocates open source, information transparenc, and civic participation, launched its first event “hackath0n” at the end of 2012 with the slogan “Code to refactor society.” The movement of civic hacking has continued ever since.

Over the past 8 years, thousands of participants have joined g0v hackathons and created tools and platforms that promote open data and open government. Many g0vers have created these tools to reduce the digital divide and facilitate access to public information for everyone, so that awareness of public affairs can be raised, and that deliberation and decision-making can be fact-bassed.

In this global movement of open data and open government, g0v community has created a new model for the citizens and government officials to interact, communicate, and collaborate together.
