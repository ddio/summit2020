## About g0v Summit

The g0v International Biennial Summit focusing on open government, open-source collaboration, and citizen participation.  It is the focus of the international open government community. The past six years have attracted speakers from 23 countries. All the biennial sections are organized by community participants, and the agenda also adheres to an open and collaborative spirit. All agendas have interpreting, online shared notes, and live streaming. In addition to the planned agenda, We also have "Unconference" with a full period of time in which content is determined by participants' proposals, by creating new collaborative spaces in the form of speeches, discussions, and free dialogue. Before the closing ceremony, the free registration of the lightning-talk is more of an open-source community tradition, which runs through this summit with an open and shared spirit.
