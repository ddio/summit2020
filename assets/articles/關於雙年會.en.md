## About g0v Summit

g0v Summit is a biennial gathering focuses on open government, open-source collaboration, and citizen participation.  It is a high-profile event of the international open government community. The past 3 times have attracted speakers from 33 countries. All the Summit sections are organized by community contributors, and the agenda adheres to an open and collaborative spirit. Documents and discussions during preparation are made public as collaborative notes. Participants are encouraged to share and cowork their notes during sessions. Simultaneous interpretation and live streaming are provided to lower the barrier of participation. In addition to the planned agenda, we also have "Unconference" with a full period of time in which content is determined by participants' proposals, to create new collaborative spaces in the form of speeches, discussions, and free dialogue. Finally, lightning-talks, which everyone is free to sign up, is more of an open-source community tradition, signifies the open and shared spirit which runs through this Summit.
