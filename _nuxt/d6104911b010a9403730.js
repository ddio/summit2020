It was established in 2014 by the g0v community. The past two summits have gathered speakers from 19 countries and more than 2,000 local and international participants. The summit is run by volunteers, and it itself is a huge collaborative project of the community. We aim to build an open environment for everyone. Volunteers will help write online shared notes, make livestreaming videos, and do realtime translation, all of these are released under open licenses. Besides formal sessions, we emphasize on “unconference”, which enables participants to host sessions and organize their own summit. As part of the tradition in open source events, the summit always ends with lightening talks when everyone can share their projects on the stage.\n\nAll sessions will have simultaneous bidirectional interpretation between English and Mandarin\n\n[Sponsor the Event](mailto:g0v-summit-partner-2018@googlegroups.com)  |  [Media Registration](https://goo.gl/forms/ND566FsQRP32fHJs2)  | [Call For Paper (Closed)](https://summit.g0v.tw/2018/cfp)\n"},457:function(e,n,t){"use strict";t.r(n),n.default="---\ntags: g0v-summit, 2020\nid: 共同主辦介紹\nlanguage: en\ntitle: 網站文案／共同主辦介紹-en\n---\n# 共同主辦介紹-英\n\n## g0v jothon\n\ng0v jothon is the task force of g0v.tw bi-monthly hackathon, there are currently six volunteers and three staffers.
